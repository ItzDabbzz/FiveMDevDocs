# Dabz's Rules

- 1) Minimize Restarts. Keep uptime above 99.99% at all times.
- 2) Test before you push.. Tune before you push.. Edit before you push.. Touch every single file in a resource, to make sure its 100% ready.
- 3) All github commits must contain detail on whats changed
- 4) All changes are forseen by Dabz, and none will be pushed to the server until approved by him.
- 5) The city relies heavily on Ox_Lib - https://overextended.dev/ox_lib
- 5) All vehicles must use a certain format and structure when being added to the server or it will be rejected. ( Make sure all vehicle handling meta's are clean and only for that specific vehicle. no others.)
